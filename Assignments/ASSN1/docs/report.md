## Problem 1

> Answers to the following questions.
>
> (a) How many floating point operations are being performed in your vector add kernel? Explain.
>
> (b) How many global memory reads are being performed by your kernel? Explain.
>
> (c) How many global memory writes are being performed by your kernel? Explain.

### (a)

`N` with vectors of length `N`. For each pair of the two input vectors, one floating point operation is performed.

### (b)

`2N` with vectors of length `N`. For each pair of the two input vectors, two global memory reads are performed to get each value.

### (c)

`N` with vectors of length `N`. For each entry of the output vector, one global memory write are performed to write results.

## Problem 2

> Your version of `template.cu`.

Please refer to the attached [`template.cu`](template.cu).

## Problem 3

> Execution times of the kernel with the input data generated by the dataset generator (in a table or graph). Please include the system information where you performed your evaluation. For time measurement, use `gpuTKTime_start` and `gpuTKTime_stop` functions (You can find details in `libgputk/README.md`).

Please refer to the attached [`evaluation.md`](evaluation.md). 'Performing CUDA computation' column expresses the execution times of the kernel. Note that it is generated by [`manage.py`](scripts/manage.py).
