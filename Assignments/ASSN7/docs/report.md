# Assignment 7. SpMV with JDS format

Minjae Gwon, Department of Computer Science and Engineering.

## Problem 1

> Two versions of `template.cpp` with and without shared memory staging (brining data into shared memory for computation and writing back at the end)

- Please refer to the attached `template.cu`.
- To get the version using shared memory, please define `USING_SHARED_MEMORY`, e.g. uncomment line 15 in `template.cu`.

## Problem 2

> The result as a table/graph of kernel execution times for different input data, with the system information where you performed your evaluation. Run your implementation with the input generated by the provided dataset generator. For time measurement, use `gpuTKTime_start` and `gpuTKTime_stop` functions (You can find details in `libgputk/README.md`).

- Please refer to the attached `evaluation.pdf`. 'Performing CUDA computation' column expresses the execution times of the kernel. Note that it is generated by `scripts/manage.py`.
